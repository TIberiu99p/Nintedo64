<p>Since the Nintendo 64s release back in 1996 there have been a lot of improvements since the Nintendo Switch came out which is the newest Nintendo console to go back to using cartridges since the N64. While it is very obvious the advancement of technology has been incredible, a lot of arguments can be made that the N64 was superior especially during its time. The processing unit used inside the N64 was a custom PU called the NEC VR4300 which was as powerful as your standard computer at that time. Thanks to this it was able to process 64-bit processes (hence the name) which wasn't normal for most video games. Most took advantage of a standard 32-bit to save memory. However, this takes its toll on a console like this because there was only 4MB of RAM which could be advanced to 8MB with an installment. On the other hand the Nintendo Switch has access to a total of 4GB of RAM which is a massive leap from what the N64 was capable of. With the obvious of advancement of technology since the late 1900s there are a lot of features that were never taken into or could have been taken into consideration when it came to the consoles. For instance the Switch supports a standard headphone jack which is something the N64 didn't take into consideration, but there are things like touch screen which the Switch supports and the N64 never had the tech to utilize. The N64 was reliant on controller ports while the Switch has advanced and allows wireless ans supports USB 2.0 and 3.0. The Nintendo Switch has 32 GB of on board memory, but by todays standards it isn't very good but the memeory cards can be expanded. As stated both consoles use cartridges and it is very noticeable how different they are.</p>

<p>The N64 had very larger cartridges due to technology being limited. Their games typically used 64-bit meaning more space was needed to hold all of this which lead to bigger sized cartridges. The Nintendo Switch completely swaps this around and uses very small cartridges (Game cards) which can stall 32 GB, this is simply thanks to how technology has advanced. The biggest thing that can be compared between the two is the prupose the consoles serve. The N64 was designed to be a family console which it does very well, however the Nintendo Switch is a hybrid. It is both a family console and is portable to be taken on the go. It makes for a very different and enjoyable experience.</p>

<p>The Legend of Zelda is an extremely popular title that has been a fan favourite franchise. Each console respectively has had a game from this franchise released on it that being the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time for the N64 and Legend of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild for the Switch. BOTW is one of the highest rated games of the generation with already owning the unofficial title of 'best console launch title ever'. It traditionally adopts the open world playstyle from the original Ocarina of Time, but thanks to the capabilities of the Nintendo Switch it allowed the developers to make the game look stunning asthetically compared to the N64 Zelda game which undoubtly doesn't look as polished. While BOTW expands the series in massive ways it is due to how limited the N64 was, but from a gameplay standpoint there are several arguments which point to Ocarina of Time being a better game even for its time. Even though the art style looks better it can be boiled down to being very simplistic in gameplay compared to Ocarina. Both Bosses and Dungeons in the Ocarina of Time were very complex and refined. However BOTW doesn't take this approach, these elements are over-simplified. The biggest thing to compare would be the open world aspect between both games. Ocarina was one of the biggest game-worlds ever created for its time, but the hardware limitations forced the game's aesthateic nature to be very barren. BOTW on the other hand is considered a masterpiece to most. The scale of the game is incredible and there are a multitude of ways to travel across this vast landscape, something Ocarina didn't have. While all of this could be determined by how restricted the N64 was for its time, it isn't hard to argue Ocarina was ground breaking for its time and still is now.  </p> 
    
<p>Overall the Nintendo Switch is undoutbly a huge jump from the capabilities of the N64 especially when it comes to the advancement of technology allowing us to have stronger processing speeds and intenal memory for example. Nintendo is heading in the right direction if they choose to follow the concept of cartridge based consoles to surpass the N64s legacy.</p>
