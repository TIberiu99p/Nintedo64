<h1>1. It was almost given a different name.</h1>
    <p>It was originally planned to to be called Ultra 64 by consumers. This was a work in progress title but they learned that Konami had the word "Ultra" trademarked for its Ultra Games division.</p> 
    
<h1>2. Nintendo sold Mario Party with protective gloves.</h1>
    <p>In Mario Party there were a lot of game modes that required the controller stick to be moved rapidly and a lot of complaints were realeased about getting blisters as well as other wounds like friction burns. To avoid this issue any further they sold gloves to solve this, but as years went on less and less parents called in about this issue.</p>

<h1>3. Legend of Zelda was almost a first person game.</h1>
    <p>If Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time was made in first person it might have set the course for all the games of its series.The idea was when you engaged in contect it would swap to third person. I think this would have been a interesting but unfavourable approach and we are lucky they decided to take the third person perspective for the franchise.</p> 
 
<h1>4. Super Mario Bros.64 is still the bestselling game on the N64.</h1>
    <p>Super Mario 64 is the bestselling game on the N64 by a very large margin. It sold about 11.89 million copies and in comparison to Mario Kart which sold 9.87 million.</p>

<h1>5. The N64 was the first console with four control ports.</h1>
    <p>The Nintendo 64 was the first console with four controller ports which encouraged split-screen family gaming. It was also the intro of contemporary console design in the form of an analogue stick.</p> 
  
<h1>6. Online gaming existed but it was only available in Japan</h1>
    <p>Back then online gaming wasn't a popular or normal thing, but Nintendo did try to bring their gamers together with the Nintendo 64DD which was a peripheral that allowed players to interact via the Internet. By the time this tech was released it was out of date for its time and slowly became irrelevant.</p>

<h1>7. As the N64 became popular more variants were released.</h1>
    <p>The Nintendo 64 is well known for being the grey box originally released. As the console grew in popularity they released a whole bunch of colours for it such as green, blue, orange, red, black and pink. There were also special edition variants including two blue and one orange Pikachu version. There was also a Pokemon battle set version and a Jungle Green edition to commemorate the release of Donkey Kong 64.</p>
    
<h1>9. The Nintendo 64 was the last major cartridge console.</h1>
    <p>The Nintendo 64 held the title of being the last major cartridge based console. Despite there being a huge industry in disc drive games which the Playstation took advantage of. However, recently the Nintendo Switch was released which went back to their classic cartridge based consoles even if the content could also be downloaded online via the Internet.</p>

<h1>8. When the Nintendo 64 was released it had two games in the US.</h1>
    <p>When the Nintendo 64 was released there were only two available games being Super Mario 64 and Pilot Wings 64. Japan was lucky enough to get access to a third being Saikyo Habu Shogi. Even though there were only two games Nintend0 released a library of games at the time which brough a total of 400 playable games.</p>  
    
<h1>10. The N64 release date was pushed back to 1996.</h1>
    <p>The N64 was delayed until 1996, after Sega's Saturn and Sony's Playstation had already come out. However the impending release coupled with the N64's low-cost meant that many people waited for the N64 anyways.</p>
